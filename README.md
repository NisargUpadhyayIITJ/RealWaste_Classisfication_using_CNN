Readme Content for Waste Classification Code
# Project Overview:
This code implements a waste classification model using TensorFlow and the InceptionV3 architecture. It aims to categorize waste images into nine different classes: Cardboard, Food Organics, Glass, Metal, Miscellaneous Trash, Paper, Plastic, Textile Trash, and Vegetation.

## Key Features:
Transfer Learning: Leverages the pre-trained InceptionV3 model for feature extraction, significantly reducing training time and improving accuracy.

Data Augmentation: Employs data augmentation techniques like rescaling to enhance the dataset and prevent overfitting.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using accuracy and loss metrics, visualizing results with plots for both training and validation sets.

Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed breakdown of the model's classification accuracy for each waste class, highlighting areas for potential improvement.

Model Saving and Loading: Enables saving the trained model for future use and loading it for inference on new waste images.

Prediction Visualization: Visualizes the model's prediction confidence scores for each class using bar graphs, making it easy to interpret results.


## How to Use the Code:

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have TensorFlow, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy installed. The code also upgrades the jax library.

Dataset Preparation: Organize your waste images into folders named after each class within a main directory.

Modify directory variable: Change the directory variable to point to your dataset's main directory.

Run the Code: Execute the code cells in order to train the model, evaluate its performance, and visualize predictions.

Save and Load the Model: Utilize the model.save and tf.keras.models.load_model functions to save the trained model and load it later for inference.

## Potential Improvements:

Experiment with Hyperparameters: Fine-tune the learning rate, optimizer settings, and dropout rate to potentially improve accuracy.

Explore other Architectures: Investigate other pre-trained models or architectures to see if they achieve better results on your dataset.

Collect More Data: Increase the size and diversity of your dataset to enhance model generalizability.

Implement Active Learning: Use active learning strategies to prioritize the labeling of new data points that would be most beneficial for the model.
